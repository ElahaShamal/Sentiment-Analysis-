# Sentiment-Analysis-
Research Question
Utilizing Yelp reviews and performing sentiment analysis, can we identify San Diego park-goers safety concerns?

## Background and Prior Work
I was surprised to find an article about the garbage located in Balboa Park. “Newspapers and barbershop bottles and anchovy cans and frozen dinners, all thrown away by a mid-century generation of San Diegans, sitting and stinking in the middle of a park, in the middle of the city. You might never know the dirt-covered, uneven acres between Pershing Drive and Florida Drive are hiding mountains of trash”. This article made me wonder if there is more garbage hidden in other parks as well (1).

There are a few statistics that show residents don’t use San Diego parks because of safety and cleanliness. “according to a survey given to residents. About 64 percent said they don’t feel safe in the area and listed safety, cleanliness, and noise as the park’s main issues” (2).

I watched a YouTube video posted by ABC 10 news that talked about San Diego parks playgrounds. “Only 5 playgrounds have been inspected in San Diego in the last 23 years this is one of the big problems found in an audit of the park and recreation department(3).

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that residents and park-goers will post reviews on yelp in concern for their safety.

Parks are a place that families and kids go; therefore, their safety is a priority and a major concern. Considering these reviews, San Diego's park and recreation department will want to take these concerns seriously and make a safe environment for park-goers.

## Dataset(s)
The yelp dataset has columns of yelp text reviews and ratings. The reviews will be from individuals who are concerned about their safety and had a bad experience. I will have two observations, the good reviews, and the bad reviews. I will be focusing mostly on negative reviews. I think I will be able to find the data I need by searching for the specific words in the reviews.
